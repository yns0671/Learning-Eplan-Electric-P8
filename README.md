# learning-eplan-electric-p8
Practice projects created while learning EPLAN Electric P8 for automation systems.

This repository contains two beginner-level automation projects designed and documented using **EPLAN Electric P8**. These projects are part of my learning process as a senior Electrical Engineering student, and they demonstrate basic principles of control systems, safety design, and mode switching in automation.

## ðŸ›  Projects Included

### 1. Door Automation System

This project simulates an **automatic sliding door** control system with both manual and automatic modes. The system includes safety features and basic motion logic.

#### ðŸ”§ Features
- **Forward and reverse movement** of the door controlled via push-buttons.
- Door movement **continues until fully open or fully closed** using end-position detection.
- **Obstacle detection** using a pressure sensor to stop movement when something blocks the door.
- **Manual/Automatic mode selector switch** to allow control mode changes.

#### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Start/stop control logic
- Sensor integration
- Safety interlocks
- Mode switching

### 2. Elevator Automation System

A basic simulation of a **3-floor elevator** controlled through call buttons and in-cabin floor selection buttons.

#### ðŸ”§ Features
- **Call buttons** at each floor (Call 1, 2, 3) and **floor selection buttons** inside the elevator (Floor 1, 2, 3).
- **LED indicators** to show elevator position on each floor.
- **Electric motor control** via contactors for up/down motion.
- **Limit switches** on each floor to detect elevator position.
- **Overload protection sensor** to stop the system in case of excessive load.
- **Emergency stop buttons** located at key points in the system.
- **Manual/Automatic mode selection** with a switch.

#### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Sequential control logic
- Safety integration
- Motor and contactor control
- Sensor feedback and floor logic

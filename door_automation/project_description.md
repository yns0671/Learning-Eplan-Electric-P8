# Door Automation System

This project simulates an automatic sliding door control system with both manual and automatic modes. The system includes safety features and basic motion logic.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Forward and reverse movement of the door controlled via push-buttons.
- Door movement continues until fully open or fully closed using end-position detection.
- Obstacle detection using a pressure sensor to stop movement when something blocks the door.
- Manual/Automatic mode selector switch to allow control mode changes.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Start/stop control logic
- Sensor integration
- Safety interlocks
- Mode switching

# ðŸ”¥ Fire Emergency Automation System

This project designs an automatic fire response system for three factory zones: **office**, **production line**, and **chemical storage**.

## ðŸ”§ System Overview
- Smoke and heat sensors detect fire and send signals to the **PLC**.
- Emergency exit doors **automatically open** in the affected zone.
- **Evacuation lights** activate to guide toward the nearest exit.
- **Exhaust fans** start to support safe evacuation.
- **Occupancy sensors** detect remaining people inside.

## âš¡ Power & Control Design
- All electrical schematics (PLC modules, terminals, cables) are designed using **EPLAN Electric P8**.
- A **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** ensures continued operation during power failure.
- UPS feeds both the **PLC** and all **emergency devices**.
- The UPS power line is shown as a separate supply in the **distribution panel** with clear device connections.

# Elevator Automation System

A basic simulation of a 3-floor elevator controlled through call buttons and in-cabin floor selection buttons.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Call buttons at each floor (Call 1, 2, 3) and floor selection buttons inside the elevator (Floor 1, 2, 3).
- LED indicators to show elevator position on each floor.
- Electric motor control via contactors for up/down motion.
- Limit switches on each floor to detect elevator position.
- Overload protection sensor to stop the system in case of excessive load.
- Emergency stop buttons located at key points in the system.
- Manual/Automatic mode selection with a switch.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Sequential control logic
- Safety integration
- Motor and contactor control
- Sensor feedback and floor logic
